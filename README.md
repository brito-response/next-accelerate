# ⚡ Next Accelerate

**Next-accelerate** is a command-line tool (CLI) that automates repetitive tasks during the development of Next.js projects, already implementing part of the architecture with ready-to-use templates, provided that:

## Requirements

> The Next.js project already exists following the (App Router) pattern.
> Your project follows the standardized folder structure using (Nested Layouts or Layout Composition) and Route Groups.

## 📦 Installation

You can run the CLI **without installing anything globally** using `npx`:

```bash
npx next-accelerate singular_resource_name

```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g next-accelerate

```

### For now, the CLI only offers the following features

1. Create default folders for resources.

At the end, you can run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And see your project more structured and faster.

Let's develop! 🚀

## 📁 Generated structure (example)

```txt
src/
├─ app/
| └── (publics)/
| └───(privates)/ _resources_dirs_
├─ components/
├─ hooks/
├─ lib/
├─ services/
└─ utils/

```

> The structure can evolve with new versions of the CLI.
